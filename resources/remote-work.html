					<p>Yikes.</p>
					<p>All of these statements are working off of either wrong assumptions or process failures. Remote work is
						getting a bad name when in fact there are easily identifiable behaviors and policies that are causing the
						problems.</p>
					<p>Effective remote work starts at the top. When company culture leaders correct non-remote friendly behaviors
						and put inclusive processes in place, the effects trickle down into a successful experience for everyone.

					<p>Remote team communication requires two basic things: thoughtful consideration and some adaptations for the
						virtual office.</p>
					<p>As more teams go digital and turn to remote work, it‚Äôs important to remember that the kinds of nuanced
						communication you get in an office setting don‚Äôt necessarily translate online.</p>
					<p>Setting some ground rules for team communication goes a long way in making sure your team is productive and
						happy.</p>

					<p>Tools matter more in remote work because they are the foundation for communication. You cannot walk up to
						someone‚Äôs desk to talk to them; you need to adapt tools to become your "virtual office." After all, if
						technology hadn‚Äôt advanced to what it is today, remote work wouldn‚Äôt even be possible.</p>
					<p>Here‚Äôs a roundup of the most important types of tools you need to consider for remote work, as well as some
						specific recommendations.</p>

					<h2>How to create a company culture as a remote team</h2>
					<img class="image"
						src="https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/4kHCHtAwkr4AMj6hlYehMB/6a92587951a7342ddcd3ff8c6308c30f/culture-team.png?w=1140&fm=webp"
						alt="">
					<p>One of the biggest concerns when considering remote-friendly work is the perceived culture hit. Workplaces
						have relied on co-location to build corporate culture for so long that it seems bleak to think of a December
						without the requisite tinsel-and-punch office holiday party.</p>
					<p>The key to building great remote relationships is intention. You need to try harder to find common
						interests, have meaningful meetings, and truly understand each person's perspective. The result can be a
						lasting network of true friends that you can depend on, no matter where your travels might take you.</p>
					<p>Creating a strong remote team culture depends on two things:</p>
					<p>1. A clear set of "rules to live by" that have 100% buy-in across the company. <br>
						2. A healthy system of meetings, events, and habits that keep people communicating.</p>
					<p>Oh, and don't forget to use a lot of üòÑ and üëç</p>

					<p>In 2018, 56% of companies around the world allowed employees to work remotely.</p>
					<p>Remote opportunities aren‚Äôt just becoming easier to source, they are being developed by companies who are
